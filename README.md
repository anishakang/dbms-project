# Scheduling System for DTH Operators

DBMS J Component Project by Manasvi and Anisha

## Introduction
DTH Operators like Airtel, TATA Sky, Sun Direct, Videocon DTH, Jio DTH and Dish TV
all employ a sort of programme scheduling system by means of which, the
programmes are scheduled and subsequently aired on TV. While for most channels,
the channels finalise the list using a scheduling system, the programmes to be aired on
the premium VoD channels are entered into the scheduling system by the DTH
operators, and then aired on TV.

## Proposal 
With our project, we aim to incorporate the essence of the scheduling system utilized
by major DTH companies into a simple and easy-to-understand Scheduling System.
